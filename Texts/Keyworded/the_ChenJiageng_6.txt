Description
Proceedings of the 6th International Conference,
ISPEC 2010, Seoul, Korea, May 12-13, 2010 In this paper, we discovered a new class of colliding key pairs
of RC4, namely, two dierent secret keys generate the same internal
state after RC4's key scheduling algorithm This is to our knowledge the
rst discovery of RC4 colliding keys with hamming distance greater than
one, that is, the colliding key pairs we found can dier from each other at
three dierent positions, and the value dierence between these positions
needs not be xed We analyzed the transition pattern and evaluated the
probability of the existence of this new class of colliding key pairs Our
result shows that RC4 key collision could be achieved by two keys with
greater hamming distance than the ones found in [1] and [2] And this
newly discovered class of colliding key pairs reveals the weakness that
RC4's key scheduling algorithm could generate even more colliding keys Some concrete colliding key pairs are demonstrated in
this paper, among which 55-byte colliding key pair is the shortest one
we found by using our algorithm within one hour time
1 Introduction
The RC4 stream cipher is one of the most famous ciphers widely used in real
world applications such as Microsoft Oce, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP), etc Due to its popularity and simplicity, RC4 has
become a hot cryptanalysis target since its specication was made public on the
Internet in 1994 [3] Another popular cryptanalysis area for
RC4 is in the WEP environment It describes the existence of secret
key pairs that generate the same initial states after key scheduling algorithm It was pointed
out by Grosul and Wallach [1] that RC4 has related-key pairs that generate
hundreds of substantially similar output bytes when the key size is close to the
full 256 bytes In Matsui's paper [2], much stronger key collisions with shorter key

for a related key pair of an arbitrary xed length which can lead to key collisions
was presented
In both [1] and [2], the colliding keys found only have hamming distance of
1 In this paper, we demonstrate another class of colliding key pairs Diering
from [1] and [2], we showed for the rst time that there exist colliding key pairs
whose hamming distance is 3, which is greater than 1 That is, two colliding
keys we found could dier at three positions and the value dierences at these
three dierent positions do not need to be xed Our result shows that there
exist many more colliding key pairs than previously expected We estimated the
number of colliding key pairs within this newly found class and also we proposed
a search algorithm which can be used to easily nd such colliding key pairs
Structure of the paper In Section 2, we brie
y describe the RC4 algorithm
followed by some previous works on RC4 key collision in Section 3 In Section 4,
we explain our new transition pattern which will lead to the collision Some techniques needed for the probability analysis,
the total number of colliding key pairs we found and some concrete colliding key
examples are summarized in the Appendix1 Description of RC4
The internal state of RC4 consists of a permutation S of the numbers 0; :::;N ??1
and two indices i; j 2 f0; :::;N ??1g The index i is determined and known to the
public, while j and permutation S remain secret RC4 consists of two algorithms:
The Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo Random Generator Al-
gorithm (PRGA) At the end, we obtain the initial state SN??1
Once the initial state is created, it is used by PRGA to generate a keystream
of bytes which will be XORed with plaintext to generate ciphertext In [1], the authors
pointed out that for secret keys with lengths close to 256 bytes, it's possible for
two keys to generate similar internal states after KSA and thus may generate
hundreds of similar bytes output during PRGA However, their discovery cannot
be strictly called key collision and their result only works for key length close to
256 Under the above condition, [2] is
able to nd a transition pattern that could lead to a total collision after KSA
The intuition behind the transition pattern is that from the rst time i touches
the dierent position t, the pattern ensures that there will always be only two
dierences in the internal state as the key scheduling process goes on And the
dierence is absorbed when i touches t for the last time Please refer to [2] for
the detailed description
Our result shows that RC4 key collision can also be achieved even if the
hamming distance between two keys is greater than 1 Also, diering from [2],
our transition pattern is a self-absorbing type, which means that once the internal
states dierences are generated due to the key dierences, they will be absorbed
very quickly and the internal states returns to the same till i touches the next
key dierence We show this interesting pattern in the following section1 Notations and intuitions
The following are the notations used in this paper
d: Index of the rst position where the values of the two secret keys dier
from each other
k: The length(bytes) of the secret key
n: The number of times K1[d]; :::;K1[d + t + 1](K2[d]; :::;K2[d + t + 1])
appear during the KSA In or-
der to understand how a key pair with the relation described before can achieve
collision after KSA, we explain by illustrating three examples with dierent
d; t; n In the simple case where n = 1 (dierent positions appear only once
during KSA), example 1 and 2 are given to show that collision can be achieved
by various d and t We analyze the key scheduling process for key pairs
with the above relation that can lead to collisions We summarize the transition
pattern in the Table 1,2 and 3, which helps in tracking the internal state of
RC4 when i touches the dierent positions of the two keys The internal state
part of each table tracks the information of i; j;K and S-BOX generated by the
two keys Notice that the value of S-BOX denotes the state after the swap The
\Dierence" part of each table tells us the dierence between two internal states
at time i d = 2; t = 2; n = 1(k = 256)

256 ?? j1 + 2 4 * 4 3 2 5 * j1;2 = j2;2 ?? 2; S1 6= S2
3 X + 2 X + 7 * 2 S[X + 7] 4 5 * K1[3] = K2[3] + 2
X X + 7 * 4 S[X + 7] 2 5 * j1;3 = j2;3; S1 6= S2
4 256 ?? X ?? 7 4 * 2 S[X + 7] 4 5 * K1[4] = K2[4]
256 ?? X ?? 7 2 * 2 S[X + 7] 4 5 * j1;4 = j2;4 + 2; S1 = S2
5 Y Y + 9 * 2 S[X + 7] 4 S[Y + 9] * K1[5] = K2[5] ?? 2
Y + 2 Y + 9 * 2 S[X + 7] 4 S[Y + 9] * j1;5 = j2;5; S1 = S2
Let's demonstrate the case in which the key length is k = 256 byte, d = 2 and
t = 2 Our key pattern requires that K1[d] = K2[d]??t, K1[d+1] = K2[d+1]+t,
K1[d + t + 1] = K1[d + t + 1] ?? t and all other parts of the key must be the
same Now we describe how the new transition pattern works Since
j1;2 = j1 +2+K1[2] and j2;2 = j1 +4+K2[2] then according to the key pattern,
we know that K1[2] = 256 ?? j1 and K2[2] = 256 ?? j1 + 2 When
i increases to d + 1, we need K1[d + 1] and K2[d + 1] to absorb the dierence
between j1 and j2 When i touches d+t, namely, i = 4, we need j1;4 = d+t and j2;4 = d,
namely, j1;4 = 4 and j2;4 = 2 so that the dierence between the two S-Boxes is
absorbed Now the internal dierence exists only between j1;4 and j2;4 Finally
when i = d+t+1, namely, i = 5, then K1[d+t+1](Y) and K2[d+t+1])(Y+2)
are there to absorb the dierence between j1;4 and j2;4 For the rest of the
steps(i > d + t + 1), the internal state remains the same, until the end of KSA
Table 1 describes the above transition procedure3 Example 2 (d = 3; t = 3; n = 1(k = 256))
In Example 2, we change the values d and t to demonstrate that parameters
d; t need not be xed in order to achieve collisions4 Example 3 (d = 4; t = 2; n = 2(k = 128))
Notice that Examples 1 and 2 directly apply to the situations where the three
dierent positions of the key appear only once during the KSA, such as the
256-byte key However, when the three dierent positions of the key appear
more than once, in other words, when the key becomes short, extra conditions
need to be satised in order to achieve collision Table 3 is one example for
k = 128; d = 4; t = 2; in this case, the dierent positions of the key will appear
twice during KSA This example will give us all the techniques for even shorter
keys In order to extend the pattern to normal situations, we use abstract values
such as a; b instead of specic values
In this example, index 4; 5; 7 is the rst appearance (n = 1) of the dierent
positions of the key, while index 132; 133; 135 is the second appearance (n = 2)
After i touches index 135, the two internal states become same for the rest of
KSA Because the key pairs are determined during the rst appearance (index
4; 5; 7), index 132; 133; 135 have to use the same keys as index 4; 5; 7 d = 4; t = 2; n = 2(k = 128)

natural to think that in order for the transition pattern to work for shorter keys,
there are some extra conditions that need to be satised and the requirement
for those extra conditions come from the fact that keys are determined in the
rst appearance and could not be changed from that point According to the
transition table 3, we can derive j1;134 = j1;133 + K1[6] + S1;133[134] = (X +
S[133] + 134) + (254 ?? X ?? a ?? b) + (j3 ?? j131 + 134 + a ?? d), thus S[133] =
a + b + j131 ?? j3 ?? a + d ?? 132 We also know from the table that S[132] =
j3 ??j131 +132+a??d This is exactly the
extra condition that our transition sequence should satisfy in the case of n = 2
In summarizing, the following conditions should be satised in order to achieve a
collision for case d = 4; t = 2; n = 2(k = 128) All the conditions could be derived
from the transition table 3 except for the little tricky one S[132]+S[133] = a+b,
which we have just calculated From
the above analysis, we could easily derive the sucient and necessary conditions
for our transition pattern, namely,
1
Assume that K1 and K2 form a k byte key pair which has the following
properties: K1[d] = K2[d] ?? t, K1[d + 1] = K2[d + 1] + t, K1[d + t + 1] =
K1[d + t + 1] ?? t for some t, d and n From the previous section, we know the
conditions for our transition pattern Now we formalize some conditions into
events for convenience in the analysis The probability of Event E is the complement of Event D,
namely, 1 ?? ( 254
256 )d+pk??1
According to the law of total probability, we have
P(B) = P(BjD)P(D) + P(BjE)P(E)

Fig Event B
Figure 1 shows the experimental and theoretical results with d + pk from
3 to 200 From the gure, we can see that the theoretical result agrees with
the experimental result very well Notice that the probability of Event B is not
aected by value t
Before evaluating Event C, let's rst look at the following Lemma 3 The probability of Sv[v

(1) When u = v

P(Sv[v

where n = v ?? u Thus the probability is ( 255

this to happen, rst, we need u to remain untouched before i touches it, other-
wise u will be swapped somewhere before i and the chance for it to be swapped
to index v
0
will be lost Then when i touches
u, we have several choices, either to swap u directly to index v
0
(we call this one
hop), or to swap u to an intermediate index t1 between index u and v, and then
when i touches t1, u can be swapped to index v
0
(we call this two hops), etc As
you may guess, there exist maximum v ?? u hops Thus the probability is ( 255

256  Then when i touches t1, u is swapped to index v

with probability

remains untouched for v ?? t1 ?? 1 rounds Notice that
the intermediate index t1 can vary between u + 1 and v ?? 1, thus the probabil-

For cases of more than 4 hops, the above analysis works in the same way By
summing these results together, we get our nal result The theoretical result agrees well with the experimental
result, except for a few points as shown in Figure 2 Theorem 3
Now we are ready to calculate Event C by using the above Lemma and
partition techniques Refer to Appendix A for a more specic description of the
integer partitioning algorithm The probability of Event C is
P(Cd;k;p) =
#(Q(XX)??I(X))
i=0
tY??1
j=0
(Pd+pk[d + pk + j] = qij)
where Q(X) denotes the partition function with input X the number to be par-
titioned, and the output is a set of t-element tuples I(X) denotes the subset of Q(X) which satises the following con-
ditions: Sd+pk[d + pk]; :::; Sd+pk[d + pk + t ?? 1] > d + pk and Sd+pk[d + pk] 6=
d + pk, qij denotes the jth element in
tuple i of set Q(X) ?? I(X) According to the denition of Event C, our goal is to partition the sum
Sd[d]+  +Sd[d+t??1] and calculate the probability that the t-element partition
will be in position d+pk; :::; d+pk+t??1 Here, one thing to notice is that when the
dierence between (d+pk)+  +(d+pk+t??1) and Sd[d]+  +Sd[d+t??1] is larger
than 256q for some q  0, than the partition of Sd[d]+  +Sd[d+t??1]+256q
is also a possible partition for positions d + pk; :::; d + pk + t ?? 1 Thus the
input of partition function Q(X) can vary depending on the relation between
PS and PD The subset I(X) indicates partitions that will never occur in the
situation of RC4 This is easy to see because before i touches index d + pk,
S[d + pk]; :::; S[d + pk + t ?? 1] could never become a value greater than index
d + pk except for the value of the index itself, which is the case in which these
values have never been swapped before Thus Q(X)??I(X) denotes all the legal
pQartitions t??1
j=0(Pd+pk[d + pk + i] = qij) is the probability of each legal partition being in
positions d+pk; :::; d+pk+t??1 The probability is calculated by using Lemma 3,
and we have t elements for each partition, so we need to multiply them together
Since there are a total #(Q(X)??I(X)) partitions, by summing them together,
we get the probability of Event C

(mod 256) for xed k; t and various d When i
touches these positions, j should not touch d + pk and d + pk + t This gives us
the probability ( 254
256 )t??1 Assume that K1 and K2 form a k-byte key pair which has the fol-
lowing properties: K1[d] = K2[d] ?? t, K1[d + 1] = K2[d + 1] + t, K1[d + t + 1] =
K1[d+t+1]??t for some xed t, d and n Then the probability that K1 and K2
are a colliding key pair is

Proof Recall the conditions we summarized in the previous section What we are
doing here is just combining all the conditions When p = 0, there is no restriction
on Event C When p  1, according to
the previous analysis, we have
Qn??1
p=1 P(A)P(B)P(C)P(D) By multiplying these
two cases together, we get our result
Since parameters d and t are not required to be xed in our pattern, the total
probability should include various d and t This gives us the following Corollary Assume that K1 and K2 form a k-byte key pair which has the
following properties: K1[d] = K2[d]??t, K1[d+1] = K2[d+1]+t, K1[d+t+1] =
K1[d+t+1]??t Then the probability that K1 and K2 are a colliding key pair is

P(Cd;k;p)
Proof Let's look at the bounds for d and t First, for every xed d, the max
value t has to satisfy d+t = k??2, and the smallest value of t is 2 in our pattern
Corollary 1 gives us the total collision probability of two keys with length k
satisfying conditions K1[d] = K2[d]??t, K1[d+1] = K2[d+1]+t and K1[d+t+1] =
K1[d + t + 1] ?? t Thus the number of colliding key pairs could be calculated
by multiplying 28k We choose d; t such that
for a given k, they make the dierent positions of the key pair appear least
often in the KSA For example, for k = 24, we choose d = 17; t = 2 so that the
dierent positions of the key pair appear 10 times not 11 times during KSA
The probability of the 10 times dominates, so we can ignore the 11 times d; t
Our results can be seen as an approximate lower bound of the total number of
this new kind of colliding key pairs, and also we compare our work with the
results in [2] Please refer
to Appendix B for the detailed results The values in parentheses in our result
denote the chosen values of d and t
Finding the colliding key pairs we found involved some detection tricks Recall
the necessary conditions of the transition pattern we have to satisfy, namely,
Event A, Event B, Event C and Event D For Event B and Event C, we can
control them to let them occur with much higher probability We do this as
follows: assume when i touches index d ?? 1, S[d]; :::; S[d + t ?? 1] have not been
swapped, thus we can pre-compute the sum Sd[d]+  +Sd[d+t??1] = d+  +
(d+t??1) Then we compute n??1 partitions of the sum, namely, (qi;1; :::; qi;t); i 2
[1; n??1]; d for Event C Also for Event B we can calculate pi = qi;1+t according
to the partitions we calculated Now we need to adjust two secret keys during
KSA so that the values of p and q will be swapped to the corresponding positions
S[d+pk]; :::; S[d+pk+t] during the rst appearance of the secret key After the
secret key begins to duplicate during KSA, we only hope that those positions
d + pk; :::; d + pk + t will not be touched before i touches them and Event A
occurs The key point here is that we can control the behavior
of the keys to satisfy our conditions in the process of the rst key appearance
in KSA However, as the length of the key becomes shorter, in other words,
as the number of appearances of the key increases, we'll have less control over
the behavior during the KSA process Our new transition pattern requires relatively loose con-
ditions on the key pairs, namely, our colliding key pairs can dier at more than
one position and the value dierence can also be more than one We gave prob-
ability evaluations of our colliding key pairs and showed the scale of this new

positive integers] Visit the partition a1:::at Otherwise set x   aj + 1; aj   x;
j   j ?? 1
For example, Pa(11,4) will generate the following partitions:
8111; 7211; 6311; 5411; 6221; 5321; 4421; 4331; 5222; 4322; 3332
Use it twice, namely, Pa(n,t) and Pa(n,t-1) to include 0 value cases in the parti-
tions, and perform the permutation on each tuple (a1:::at) to cover all the cases
B Number of colliding key pairs
Table 4 shows the number of newly discovered colliding key pairs, compared with
[2]'s results The values in the parentheses denote d and t "-" means colliding
key pairs do not exist theoretically \-"
denotes that K1 and K2 have the same value
