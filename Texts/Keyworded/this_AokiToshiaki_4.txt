 In this paper, we propose a formal
approach to extract threads from concurrent objects However,
this is not possible in embedded system developments
because of the existence of such constraints
To obtain such design models, we propose in this paper
a transformation method from analysis model to design
model Our main
objectives in this experiment are:
- to show that we can derive a design model with our
method in a real application development, and
- to show that we can implement code based on our design
model
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows
2 Concurrent Regular Expressions
In this section, we introduce Concurrent Regular Expressions(
CREs) which are used to formalize our analysis
and design modelsI n thisp aper, we use only interleaving
and synchronous composition operators In the remainder
of this paper, we use [ ] for [o] [ ] does
not have this property
3 Formalizing Analysis and Design Models
In this section, we formalize both analysis and design
models with CREs work and exit in this orderclose
The behavior corresponding to this expression is its language However, we can describe
an expression that violates this rule
In our approach, we achieve this transformation with
an axiomatics ystem for equivalentt ransformationo n concurrent
regular expressions There are 2 rules in this
Reflection
Zero
Identity
Commutative
Associative
Distributive
Synchronous
Confliction
Interleaving
Spining
Optimizing

A[S]B= B[S]A
(A[ ]B)[ ]c = A[ ](B[ ]c)
(A + B)[S]C =
(A[S U (EB n Ec)]C) + (B[s U (EA n Ed]C)
(x1 Target Environment
We suppose that the target system for this driver has the
following hardware In this action, the
objects CH0, CH1 and CH2 calculate their output values and
SYN generates an output value for D/A from these 3 output
values4 Design Phase
In this section, we design the system6 Extracting Threads
In this section, we obtain subthreads from the design
model The caller thread of
this function enters the critical section
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the axiomatic system for the
equivalent transformation on CREs Using this transformation
we can systematically obtain design models from
an analysis model
