Title
BICM-ID for Relay System Allowing Intra-link
Errors and a Similarity Constellation to ARQ
Schemes

Issue Date 2012-03

Abstract| In this paper, we propose an accumulator-assisted (ACC) relay system with bit-
interleaved coded modulation using iterative decoding (BICM-ID) technique and apply the net-
work topology to an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme The theoretical back-
ground of this technique is the Slepian-Wolf/Shannon theorem for correlated source coding In this paper,
it is also shown that if the intra-link is error free, the topology of the relay network is equivalent
to an ARQ scheme that exploits Shannon's random coding theorem by utilising an interleaver in
the framework of ARQ Based on this observation, results of simulations conducted to evaluate
the throughput of an ARQ scheme are presented Based on this contribution, we adopt the Bit-
Interleaved Coded Modulation using Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID) technique [4] for higher order
modulation schemes
Three scenarios of diRerent relay locations are considered in this paper, as shown in Fig In this paper, memory-1 half
rate (R = 1=2) systematic non-recursive convolutional code (SNRCC) is adopted for both encoders
C1 and C2 However, this advantage is not signiï¿½Pcant for low SNRsr
scenarios In this case, the systematic bits are simply extracted instead of performing channel
decoding However, if error happens in this frame, with frame error rate (FER) denoted by P1,
second transmission takes place CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique that combines the BICM-ID with our proposed
relay scheme for higher order modulations, which allows the intra-link errors
