Title
BICM-ID for Relay System Allowing Intra-link
Errors and a Similarity Constellation to ARQ
Schemes

Issue Date 2012-03

Abstract| In this paper, we propose an accumulator-assisted (ACC) relay system with bit-
interleaved coded modulation using iterative decoding (BICM-ID) technique and apply the net-
work topology to an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme
