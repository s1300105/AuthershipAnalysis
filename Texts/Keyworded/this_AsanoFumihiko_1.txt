highest walking speed; this is produced by changing the
gait from walking to running Using
this model, we try to generate high-speed running gaits that
emerge as a natural extension of the walking gait6, 7
The primary purpose of this approach is to make overcoming
the potential barrier at midstance easy by tilting the robot�fs
impact posture forward6 The robot would jump
or should change motion to the running gait in this case
In this paper,we deal with the model of a telescopic-legged
rimless wheel that consists of eight identical telescopic
legs for analysis Generating a level walking gait is
also described in this section Section 5 concludes this paper and describes
future research directions At the end of this
section, a typical walking gait is generated using the derived
equations
7 The primary purpose of this approach is to asymmetrize
the impact posture to make overcoming the potential barrier
at midstance easy The
stance leg is on the ground in the walking or skipping gaits
as shown in this figure, whereas it is floating in the air in
the running gait�h
Definition 3 The robot starts locomotion from an initial
condition at 0 s; this is defined as the 0th collision Although Tset[i]
and T [i] do not converge to their target values, this control
is very effective for stabilization to a 1-period running gait
leg just after impact is negative, and this implies that the
impact posture is not sufficient for overcoming the potential
barrier
In this case, the desired trajectories are updated at ith
impact as follows:

1d(t )=


a5i t 5 + a4i t 4 + a3i t 3 + a0i , (0 ? t < Tset),
Le[i], (t ? Tset),

Fig In this case, the desired settling time,
Tset, cannot be systematically changed Compared with this, we
must conclude that the generated walking gaits are highly

(1) Stance phase I
The robot equations of motion during this phase are the
same as those of the walking gait: Eqs The robot equation of motion during this
phase is the same as Eq The conditions for the velocity
constraint at this phase are given by ?x
+ = 0 and?z
+ = 0
We should note, however, that the stance leg will begin
to shrink due to the impact force if this collision occurs

Let Ts [s] be the time of this collision In
this case, the first collision of the stance leg with the ground
(collision phase I) occurs more than 0 In this case,
the first collision of the stance leg occurs in the middle of
the output following control, i Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we investigated the properties of the walking,
running, and skipping gaits of the telescopic-legged rimless
